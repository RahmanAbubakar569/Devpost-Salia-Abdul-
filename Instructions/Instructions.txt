3. Set Up the Server (Linux or Windows)

Install Required Packages

From the root of the project directory, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Navigate to Server Scripts

cd Source_Code/model&server_script(win&linux)

Run the Server

- On Linux:
  python3 cashew_server.py

- On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
  python cashew_server_win.py

4. Create a Wi-Fi Access Point (Hotspot)

Linux (Debian-based)

nmcli dev wifi hotspot ifname wlan0 ssid WLAN password yourpassword

Note: Replace 'wlan0' with your Wi-Fi interface name (check with 'iwconfig' or 'nmcli device status').

Windows

1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
2. Run:

netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=CashewHotspot key=yourpassword
netsh wlan start hostednetwork

---

5. Connect Android Device

- Connect your Android phone to the CashewHotspot network.
- Launch the installed Cashew App.
- The system will begin communication with the server.

6. Set Up the Sensor

1. Insert the sensor into the soil.
2. Power the sensor using an appropriate power source (USB or battery).
3. Wait for the red LED to light up â€” this confirms power and readiness.
4. Open the Arduino code and update the Wi-Fi credentials:

const char* ssid = "WLAN";
const char* password = "yourpassword";

5. Upload the updated code to your sensor via the Arduino IDE.

System Ready

Once everything is connected:

- The sensor will transmit data to the server via Wi-Fi.
- The server will process the data.
- The Android app will display real-time soil monitoring updates.
